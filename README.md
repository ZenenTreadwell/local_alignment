This program was developed for a bioinformatics course. The purpose of the Smith-Waterman algorithm is to determine similarity between two gene sequences, according to all the ways that they might potentially mutate. 

The central feature of this implementation is the dynamic programming paradigm which finds the solution in O(mn) time, rather than the O(n^3) time that would be achieved iteratively.

The package also contains a shell script to generate unique 100-character string segments, along with a .pdf of the presentation which may provide more background information.
